## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

library(tidyverse)

# Read the diamonds dataset
data(diamonds)

# Summary statistics of diamonds dataset
summary(diamonds)


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r diamonds, echo=FALSE}
# Frequency of diamond cut within cut classes
# Variables used - x-axis cut
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=cut)) +
  geom_bar(color="blue", fill="blue") +
  labs (x = "Cut classes",
        y = "Count",
        title = "Frequency of diamond cut within cut classes") +
  theme(legend.position="top")

```

```{r diamonds, echo=FALSE}
# Total price of diamond cut within cut classes
# Variables used - x-axis cut, y axis price
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=cut, weight= price/1000)) +
  geom_bar(color="blue", fill="blue") +
  labs (x = "Cut classes",
        y = "Total price/1000 of diamond cut class",
        title = "Total price of diamond cut within cut classes") +
  theme(legend.position="top")

```

```{r diamonds, echo=FALSE}
# Total price of diamond cut within cut classes
# Variables used - x-axis cut, y axis price, fill color cut
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=cut, weight= price/1000, fill = cut)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs (x = "Cut classes",
        y = "Total price/1000 of diamond cut class",
        title = "Total price of diamond cut within cut classes") +
  theme(legend.position="right")

```

```{r diamonds, echo=FALSE}
# Stacked bar graph
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=cut, weight= price/1000, fill = clarity)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs (x = "Cut classes",
        y = "Total price/1000 of diamond cut class",
        title = "Total price of diamond cut within cut classes") +
  theme(legend.position="right")

```

```{r diamonds, echo=FALSE}
# dodge bar graph
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=cut, weight= price/1000, fill = clarity)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  labs (x = "Cut classes",
        y = "Total price/1000 of diamond cut class",
        title = "Total price of diamond cut within cut classes") +
  theme(legend.position="right")

```

```{r diamonds, echo=FALSE}
# Horizontal Stacked bar graph
ggplot(diamonds, aes(y=cut, weight= price/1000, fill = clarity)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs (y = "Cut classes",
        x = "Total price/1000 of diamond cut class",
        title = "Total price of diamond cut within cut classes") +
  theme(legend.position="right")

```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
