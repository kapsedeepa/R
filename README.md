# R
Boilerplate R code

To install RStudio, I downloaded the recent version of RStudio Desktop- Open Source License from rstudio https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/  website.
I executed the RStudio-1.3.1073.exe file and choose the default location for installing RStudio.
Then, I went to https://cran.r-project.org/ for downloading “R4.0.2 for windows(64 bit)” exe.
To load packages specified in R Studio, I clicked on install icon in packages tab. A window popped up where I could specify multiple packages in comma separated format.
